        <h2>What is an AMC for a Lift?</h2>
        <p className="section-text">
          An AMC (Annual Maintenance Contract) for a lift is a yearly service 
          agreement with a lift company that includes regular inspections,
          preventive maintenance, and emergency repairs to ensure the lift is
          safe and reliable. The contract typically covers routine checks,
          cleaning, lubrication, and may also include parts and labor,
          depending on the plan. This helps reduce breakdowns, extends the
          life of the equipment, and ensures compliance with safety
          regulations.
